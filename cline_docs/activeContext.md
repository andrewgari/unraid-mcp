## What you're working on now

Containerizing the Python MCP server located in the `/mnt/cache/compose/unraid-mcp` directory. The main script is `unraid-mcp-server.py`.

## Recent changes

- Created the `cline_docs` directory at the correct path.

## Next steps

1.  Create `Dockerfile` for the Python MCP server.
2.  Create `.dockerignore` file to optimize the Docker build context.
3.  Inspect `unraid-mcp-server.py` to determine the run command and any exposed ports.
4.  Inspect `requirements.txt` for dependencies.
5.  Update `README.md` with instructions for building and running the Docker container.
