# Progress

## What works

- The Python MCP server (`unraid-mcp-server.py`) is assumed to be functional in a local Python environment with dependencies installed from `requirements.txt`.
- `cline_docs` directory has been created at `/mnt/cache/compose/unraid-mcp/cline_docs/`.
- `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md` have been written to `cline_docs`.

## What's left to build

- `Dockerfile`
- `.dockerignore`
- Updated `README.md` with Docker build and run instructions.

## Progress status

- **Initiated**: Task of containerizing the Python MCP server has begun.
- **Documentation Created**: `cline_docs` files have been successfully written.
- **Pending**: Creation of Docker-related files and documentation updates.
